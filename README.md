# Assessing changes in an ant-aphid mutualism across urban grasslands

This repository contains the data and R code to analyse changes in aphid and ant populations and behaviour along a gradient of urbanisation in Berlin, Germany. 
This is a work in progress associated to a publication in preparation.

Abstract:
Urbanisation challenges species to cope with novel environmental conditions, which may result in the disruption of mutualistic interactions. While some mutualisms, like pollination, have been shown to be at risk in cities (Ropars et al., 2019), little is known about how other types of mutualisms are affected by urbanisation. We studied the protective mutualism between the pink tansy aphid (Metopeurum fuscoviride) and the black garden ant (Lasius niger) along an urbanisation gradient in Berlin, Germany. Repeated observations in nine locations along this gradient allowed us to quantify the investment of ants in tending aphids, the survival and growth of tended aphid colonies, and the behavioural response of ants to a simulated attack of the aphids. Aphid colonies flourished and were tended equally across the urbanisation gradient, and there was a consistent positive relationship between aphid and ant numbers. However, ants defended aphids more aggressively in more urban environments. Our study suggests that not only this protective mutualism is maintained in the city, but that ants might even rely more on it and thus defend it more aggressively. Such behavioural changes may explain in part the success of these mutualistic ants as food resources become scarce and unpredictable with urbanisation, and highlights the importance of protective mutualisms for urban biodiversity.â€ƒ
