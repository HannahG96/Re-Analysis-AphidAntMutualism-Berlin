# Assessing changes in an ant-aphid mutualism across urban grasslands

This repository contains the data and R code to analyse changes in aphid and ant populations and behaviour along a gradient of urbanisation in Berlin, Germany. 
This is a work in progress associated to a publication in preparation.

## Abstract
Urbanisation challenges species to cope with novel environmental conditions, which may result in the disruption of mutualistic interactions. While some mutualisms, like pollination, have been shown to be at risk in cities (Ropars et al., 2019), little is known about how other types of mutualisms are affected by urbanisation. We studied the protective mutualism between the pink tansy aphid (Metopeurum fuscoviride) and the black garden ant (Lasius niger) along an urbanisation gradient in Berlin, Germany. Repeated observations in nine locations along this gradient allowed us to quantify the investment of ants in tending aphids, the survival and growth of tended aphid colonies, and the behavioural response of ants to a simulated attack of the aphids. Aphid colonies flourished and were tended equally across the urbanisation gradient, and there was a consistent positive relationship between aphid and ant numbers. However, ants defended aphids more aggressively in more urban environments. Our study suggests that not only this protective mutualism is maintained in the city, but that ants might even rely more on it and thus defend it more aggressively. Such behavioural changes may explain in part the success of these mutualistic ants as food resources become scarce and unpredictable with urbanisation, and highlights the importance of protective mutualisms for urban biodiversity.

## Data collection
![](figures/Experiment.png)
We conducted a field survey in August 2018 to investigate how the mutualism between the black garden and (*Lasius niger*) and the pink tansy aphid (*Metopeurum fuscoviride*) on tansy host plants (*Tanacetum vulgare*) changes in response to urbanisation. For this purpose, we designed a field experiment to collect data on aphid numbers, number of attending ants and mutualistic ant behaviour. Data collection was replicated along an urbanisation gradient in Berlin and repeated 4-7 times at each study site. Each visit of a study site (i.e. sampling session) was determined by the study of one ant-aphid-host plant system: We started by locating the plant area with the main aphid cluster (henceforth called the “focal zone"), measured its length and counted all live aphids and mummies (parasitized aphids) within this focal zone. Then, ant behaviour was observed undisturbed, at the **(1)** group level (i.e. we counted the number of ants attending the aphids in the focal zone and recorded all ant movements into and out of the focal zone during 1 min; this was replicated five times per sampling session). Secondly, we recorded ant behaviour at **(2)** individual level via focus behaviour observations of 2-5 focal ants during 2-5 minutes each. In a third phase, we **(3)** recorded behavioural responses of individual ants targeted by a simulated attack using a needle. 

## Data files
The raw data of this study is stored in form of *.csv*-files  that are located in the folder [data](data):
- [GivenMeta_plots.csv](data/GivenMeta_plots.csv): metadata of 56 dry grassland sites located in Berlin, Germany, which form a research platform to investigate urban ecosystem functioning (see [CityScapeLab Berlin](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/6/2565) for more details). We selected nine of these sites to conduct our study which were located along a gradient of urbanisation. The percentage of sealed surfaces in a 500m buffer around the study site ("Seal_500") was used as explanatory variable to describe the gradient of urbanisation.
- [General_plot.csv](data/General_plot.csv): metadata of the nine study sites selected for the field survey, i.e. the plot ID ("plot"), the geographical coordinates ("Long", "Lat"), the number of visits of the site ("visits"), the number of sampling sessions that were undertaken ("sample size") and the number of studied ant-aphid-host plant systems ("N_plant")
- [Met_plot_date.csv](data/Met_plot_date.csv): study site metadata collected during each sampling session (i.e. study of a particular ant-aphid-host plant system at a particular date). We measured the temperature before, during and after each sampling session ("temp1","temp2","temp3") to control for temperature effects on ant behaviour. We additionally collected supporting information on weather, presence of other ant species on the host plant and presence of aphid predators to describe the ecological context of our data.
- [Met_plant.csv](data/Met_plant.csv): host plant metadata collected during each sampling session. It includes supporting information on host plant phenology ("stade1": budding, "stade2": full flowering, "stade3": end of flowering, "stade4": desiccated plant), location of the aphid colony (i.e. stalk/leaves/flower) and organisation of the aphid colony (i.e. aggregated/dispersed). We further counted the number of parasitized aphids (i.e. mummies) in the aphid colony and calculated the proportion of parasitized aphids ("prop_paras", i.e. number of parasitized aphids relative to the total number of aphids) to test how parasitism influenced the survival/extinction of aphid colonies. 
- [aphid_extinctions.csv](data/aphid_extinctions.csv): We recorded at each visit of the study site whether the previously studied ant-aphid-host plant systems survived or went extinct. The file lists the systems which went extinct during the field survey and the date of record. This information was used to test how parasitism influenced the survival/extinction of aphid colonies.
- [Exp1.csv](data/Exp1.csv): focal ant metadata. We recorded during each sampling session the behaviour of 2-5 focal ants during 2-5 minutes each using a voice recorder. The file contains supporting information about the focal ants, essentially in which plant area the ants were situated during the focus observation. This information was used to discriminate between "caretakers" (ant stays in the area of the aphid colony, i.e. in the focal zone), "scouts" (ant moves away from the aphids to explore other plant parts) and "transporters" (ant leaves the host plant). Furthermore, the behavioural record of each ant (stored in [activity sequence.csv](data/activity sequence.csv)) is linked to the focal ant by its unique identifier ("rec"). 
- [activity_sequence.csv](data/activity_sequence.csv): data of focal ant behaviour (i.e. individual level observations). This file contains the records of ant behaviour collected during focus observations of 2-5 focal ants per sampling session. The focal ant was observed during 2-5 minutes and in situ behaviour was recorded based on predefined behavioural categories using a voice recorder. The predefine behavioural categories include palpating aphids with antennae and collecting their honeydew ("cl"), walking ("w" and "wf"), standing ("st"), interacting with ants by antennae contact ("a"), trophallaxis ("k"), stretching the abdomen ("str"), grooming itself ("li") and possible other, undefined behaviours ("o"). Voice records were subsequently re-written into text files which describe what the focal ant was doing during the record (i.e. a sequence of successive behaviours. Behaviours are specified using the abovementioned code and separated by "-". Text items in brackets indicate the time duration in seconds of the behaviour.) These sequences of ant behaviours were used to calculate the total time, as proportions of total record length, the ant had allocated into the abovementioned behaviours. Each behavioural sequence has a unique identifier which links the behavioural data to the metadata of the focal ant.
- [Exp2.csv](data/Exp2.csv): data of group level observations collected during each sampling session. This file includes the measurements of the vertical length of the focal zone ("l", in mm) and counts of aphids in the focal zone ("N_aphid"). These information were used to calculate an estimate of aphid density, i.e. the number of aphids per mm focal zone length. Furthermore, we estimated the number of ants in the focal zone ("t0"-"t11"). To account for the mobility of ants we recorded every five seconds during one minute the number of ants in the focal zone, resulting in 12 counts per minute. This measurement was replicated 5 times across the sampling session and used to derive an average estimate of the number of attending ants.
- [Exp3a.csv](data/Exp3a.csv): data of group level observations after a simulated attack on the aphid colony using a needle. We simulated a predator attack on the aphids by pointing a fine needle in the center of the aphid colony and observed ant reactions: We count the number of ants entering/leaving the focal zone, the number of ants reacting with hyperactivity, the number of ants no reacting and the number of ants attacking the needle. This experiment was replicated three times per sampling session. The data of the experiment is not reported in our manuscript due to absence of patterns.
- [Exp3b.csv](data/Exp3b.csv): data of ant responses to a simulated attack. The attack was simulated by pointing a fine needle a few millimeters away from a focal ant. We recorded how the ant reacted using a score of aggressiveness ("aggr"; 1: avoidance and running away, 2: tolerance, 3: curiosity and exploring the needle, 4: avoidance and stretching the abdomen, 5-7: aggressiveness and attacking the needle). We further recorded the context in which the focal ant was disturbed ("t-1_w": walking; "t-1_st": standing, being inactive; "t-1_a": tending aphids). This experiment was replicated for 2-10 focal ants per sampling session. We used this data to estimate the number of avoiding ants vs. the number of aggressively responding ants per sampling session.
- [geodata](data/geodata) and [bezirksgrenzen.geojson](data/bezirksgrenzen.geojson): shapefile data of Berlin used to create a map of the study sites.

## How to run the code
The R code used to analyse the data of this study and to produce the figures is located in the folder [scripts](scripts).

The script [master.R](scripts/master.R) includes the entire code to reproduce the statistics and figures of the manuscript: **(1)** loads required packages; **(2)** imports the raw data; **(3)** formats the raw data and derives the response and explanatory variables; **(4)** analyses the relationships between response variables and explanatory variables using linear mixed effect models (LMMs) and generalised linear mixed effect models (GLMMs), and performs diagnostics and statistical tests; **(5)** produces the figures of the manuscript.
> IMPORTANT: to run this code, first install the required packages using the command `install.packages("packagename")` and change the working directory `working_dir <- "C:/Hannah/Bachelorarbeit/BA Publication/Re-analysis-AphidAntMutualism-Berlin"`to the one where you stored the scripts and data folders.

**Running the code step by step**
> To avoid error messages, first load the packages mentioned in [master.R](scripts/master.R) and run the scripts in the below mentioned order. 

**Importing the data** 
- run [import_data.R](scripts/import_data.R) to upload the *.csv*-files of the raw data in form of data frames into your R environment.

**Formatting the data** 
- run [transform_General_plot.R](scripts/transform_General_plot.R) to get a summary table of the field survey including the number of visits per study site ("visits.sum"), the number of sampling sessions per study site ("sampleSize.sum") and the number of studied ant-aphid-host plant systems per study site ("N_plant.sum").
- run [transform_Met_plot_date.R](transform_Met_plot_date.R) to obtain the average temperature per sampling session ("mean.temp"), calculated based on three temperature measurements per sampling session.
- run [transform_Met_plant.R](scripts/transform_Met_plant.R) to obtain the proportion of parasitized aphids (relative to the total number of counted aphids) per sampling session ("Prop_paras").
- run [transform_Exp1.R](scripts/transform_Exp1.R) to obtain the proportion of time (relative to the total record duration) that focal ants allocated in the different behaviours. This script first classifies focal ants into caretakers/scouts/transporters according to the plant area where the ant was situated during the focus observation. Next, it processes the behavioural sequences of the focal ants (`source("scripts/import activity sequence.R")`in line 44 of the code) to derive the cumulated time that each focal ant had spend into the different predefined behaviours. Finally, it calculates the average proportion of time per sampling session a caretaker/scout/transporter had allocated into tending aphids ("aphid_IA.sum"), interacting with other ants ("ant_IA.sum"), walking ("move.sum"), being inactive ("stand.sum") and doing some other task ("other.sum") - these information are included in the data frame *activ_sum*.  
- run [transform_Exp2.R](scripts/transform_Exp2.R) to obtain the aphid density (i.e. number of aphids per mm of focal zone length; "N_aphid.mm") and the average number of ants (i.e. the mean number of ants in the focal zone averaged over 5 replicate records of one minute of the ant movement in and out of the zone; "meanAnt.mean") per sampling session. Furthermore, the script calculates an estimate of average ant attendance per sampling session ("AntperAphid.mean") as the ratio of the average ant number over the aphid number.
- run [transform_Exp3a.R](scripts/transform_Exp3a.R) to derive an estimate per sampling session of the group level reaction to a simulated attack on the aphid colony using a needle. We replicated the attack simulation three times and selected the replica which triggered the most aggressive reaction by ants: therefrom were derived the number of reacting ants (i.e. hyperactivity+attacks of the needle; "MAXREACT") and the number of aggressively reacting ants (i.e attacking the needle by jumps and bites; "MAXATTACK"). (This data was not further analysed.)
-run [transform_Exp3b.R](scripts/transform_Exp3b.R) to obtain an estimate per sampling session of individual ant responses to a simulated attack using a needle. We tested ant responses to a simulated attack on 2-10 focal ants per sampling session. This script first classifies focal ants according to what the ant was doing prior the simulated attack ("context": tending aphids/other behaviour). It then categorizes the focal ant's reaction into a response with 3 outcomes ("aggr_score") based on its aggressivity score: avoidance (score 1 and 4) vs. aggressive reaction: biting (score 5-7 and "JUMP"=0) vs. aggressive reaction: jumping (score 5-7 and "JUMP"=1). (Note that in this step, observations of ants reacting with tolerance (score 2) and curiosity (score 3) were excluded from the further analysis - it resulted in 47 excluded observations.)
-run [myResponseVariables.R](scripts/myResponseVariables.R) to produce a separate data frame for each response variable that includes the explanatory variables used to model the response. The set of response variables analysed for this study consists of the aphid density ("N_aphid.mm" - data frame: Aphid_density), the average number of ants and the ant-per-aphid ratio ("meanAnt.mean" and "AntperAphid.mean - data frame: Ant_attendance), the proportion of time spent by caretakers into tending aphids ("aphid_IA.sum" - data frame: Tending_Time) and the individual ant response to a simulated attack ("reaction": avoidance vs. aggressive response - data frame: Ant_aggressivity).
The set of explanatory variables consists of the percentage of sealed surfaces in a 500m buffer around the study site ("Seal_500"), the sampling date ("date"), the aphid number ("N_aphid"), the mean ant number ("meanAnt.mean"), the mean temperature ("mean.temp") and the plant phenology ("plantStade"). The autocorrelation between explanatory variables was checked by running the command `ggpairs(expVar[,c("date","mean.temp","N_aphid","meanAnt.mean","Seal_500","plantStade")])` (line 21 of the code), resulting in the exclusion of mean temperature and plant phenology from the set of explanatory variables due to their correlation with other variables. Furthermore, explanatory variables were standardized (mean of 0; standard deviation of 1) by running the command `expVar=mutate_at(expVar, vars(date,meanAnt.mean,N_aphid,prop_paras,mean.temp,Seal_500), funs(s = as.numeric( scale(.) ) ) )` in line 29 of the code.
